JAXB is an older Java specification and is not defined by JAX-RS. 
JAXB is an annotation framework that maps Java classes to XML and XML schema. 
It is extremely useful because instead of interacting with an abstract representation of an XML document, 
you can work with real Java objects that are closer to the domain you are modeling. 
JAX-RS has built-in support for JAXB.
